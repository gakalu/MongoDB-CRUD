Please find below an Express application that connects to a local MongoDB instance, each document has the following structure for `schools` collection:
```JavaScript
{
    "_id":1,
    "teachers": [
        {"_id":1, "name":"Asaad"},
        {"_id":2, "name":"Umur"}
    ],
    "courses":[
        {"_id":1, "students":[
            {"_id":1, "name":"John"},
            {"_id":2, "name":"Selin"}
        ]},
        {"_id":2, "students":[
            {"_id":1, "name":"Alican"},
            {"_id":2, "name":"Dean"}
        ]},
        {"_id":3, "students":[
            {"_id":1, "name":"Tina"},
            {"_id":2, "name":"Clyde"}
        ]}
    ]
